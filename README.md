# Transfer Learning Techniques

Transfer learning is a powerful approach in machine learning and deep learning that leverages pre-trained models to enhance the performance of new tasks. Rather than starting from scratch, these techniques allow us to use knowledge gained from one problem domain and apply it to another related task, often with limited data.
